# PHP CRUD Application

This repository contains the source code for a simple three-tier data-driven web application using PHP, MySQL, and Apache (LAMP stack). The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete records from a database.

## Overview

The application uses the following technologies:
- **PHP**: Backend logic for handling requests and managing the CRUD operations.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing user records.
- **Apache**: Web server for serving the application.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend interface for interacting with the database.

## Setup

1. **Create a Virtual Machine**: Set up an Ubuntu VM.
2. **Install LAMP Stack**: Install Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
3. **Configure MySQL**: Add user accounts and load a sample schema with 300,000 records.
4. **Deploy Code**: Use GitHub for version control, create a tar.gz file for deployment, and deploy the app across multiple VM environments.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the LAMP stack as described above.
3. Run the `index.php` file in your browser to start using the CRUD app.

## Notes

- This project demonstrates fundamental web development practices including database connectivity, web application structure, and deployment.
